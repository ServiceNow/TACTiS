        Compute the loss function of the model.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        hist_time: Tensor [batch, series, time steps] or [batch, 1, time steps] or [batch, time steps]
            A tensor containing the times associated with the values of hist_value.
            If the series dimension is singleton or missing, then the time steps are taken as constant across all series.
        hist_value: Tensor [batch, series, time steps]
            A tensor containing the values that will be available at inference time.
        pred_time: Tensor [batch, series, time steps] or [batch, 1, time steps] or [batch, time steps]
            A tensor containing the times associated with the values of pred_value.
            If the series dimension is singleton or missing, then the time steps are taken as constant across all series.
        pred_value: Tensor [batch, series, time steps]
            A tensor containing the values that the model should learn to forecast at inference time.

        Returns:
        --------
        loss: torch.Tensor [batch]
            The loss function of TACTiS, with lower values being better.

        Generate the given number of samples from the forecasted distribution.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        num_samples: int
            How many samples to generate, must be >= 1.
        hist_time: Tensor [batch, series, time steps] or [batch, 1, time steps] or [batch, time steps]
            A tensor containing the times associated with the values of hist_value.
            If the series dimension is singleton or missing, then the time steps are taken as constant across all series.
        hist_value: Tensor [batch, series, time steps]
            A tensor containing the available values
        pred_time: Tensor [batch, series, time steps] or [batch, 1, time steps] or [batch, time steps]
            A tensor containing the times at which we want forecasts.

            Samples from the forecasted distribution.
